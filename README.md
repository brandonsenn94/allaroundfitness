One of the things that's very confusing about the fitness world is just about how many spreadsheets and misinformation there is regarding overall fitness. There's MyFitnessPal, Cronometer, etc, but they don't change your TDEE based on your weight.

This is a college-level project I'm doing in order to have a portfolio and improve upon my coding skills.


That being said, I want to create an application where it has a body fat % calculator and calorie tracker and using this information, create a recommended amount of calories that a person should eat. One of the problems with MyFitnessPal and the like is that they don't adapt to your bodyweight changes. (A 168 lb person is going to have different caloric needs than someone who is 185 lbs. The problem is that you can set up MyFitnessPal to calculate the calories needed to reach goal, but the caloric goals are static, they don't change. I want to make this app calculate average weight, and have the program adapt to whatever your average weight was that week to continue reaching whatever fitness goals you have.

Here's what steps need to be taken in order to get this app fully functional:
1) Design a GUI that is relatively easy to follow and understand. (This is going to be the most difficult part as I have no experience designing GUI, let alone knowing how to code for it.)
2) Implement back-end code to calculate weight averages and change caloric goals based on user preference.
3) Add more features down the road.
